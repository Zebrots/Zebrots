# Zebrots Gravitas #

## Heading ##
  > Gravitas

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Gravitas is a text-based peer-to-peer connection application meant to allow a small group of people (specifically a Hack Reactor cohort) to request collaboration from each other to figure out small issues during a normal work-day.

## Summary ##
  > Gravitas suppliments the HR 'Helpdesk' system by creating a space within which students can post requests for collaboration, and respond to such requests. Although the basic idea revolves around "asking for help", the product is designed to encourage students to think of it more as "invitations to collaborate", albeit briefly. By creating another layer of support for students which connects them with *each other*, it simultaneously improves student performance and also accelerates the forming of relationships between students. This will increase the overall bonding, cooperation and identity within the group.

## Problem ##
  > At Hack Reactor, the tech mentors and the HiR's are a great resource for students. However, their time and numbers are limited, and students are encouraged to rely also on their peers. However, reaching out to peers is fraught with interpersonal and social risks. Some students do not wish to appear needy. Some have bandwidth to share their knowledge, but do not feel comfortable asking around to see whether anyone needs help. It is not always clear whether someone is really wanting to donate their time and attention to helping a fellow student at any particular moment. 

## Solution ##
  > The obvious benefit is that of increasing the amount of general help and interaction available to students. But in two disctinct ways, Gravitas also greatly reduces the social inhibitions many students feel when asking for someone to join in their effort to solve a problem or understand something:
  First, since no one is asked for help directly, no one needs to overcome the inhibition of walking up to someone and interrupting them. Instead, a student simply writes an "Invite" and posts it. If someone decides to respond, both students know that the other *chose* to join the current inquiry. 
  Second, when a student is browsing currently-open invites, the identity of the student who created the invite is not displayed. Only when a student chooses to *respond* to the invite is the identity revealed. Because of this, a student can post an invite without worrying about what others may think of them for doing so.
  Then, as an additional resource for students, each invite to which someone responds requires the user to post a brief 'take-away', which is stored in the database and is then permanently searchable by other students based on tags associated with each take-away. In some cases, these take-aways may be all the help a student needs.

## Quote from You ##
  > "After the release of Gravitas, the degree of synergy experienced by Hack-Reactor cohorts will cause them to sublime into the celestial aether!" - Reuben Nahouraii, CKO, Zebrots International

## How to Get Started ##
  > For students, using Gravitas requires almost no investment of time or energy. They create a user account (which simply piggy-backs on their Github account) and then post a request for another student to come join them. This process is very similar to posting a HelpDesk ticket, and so will already be familiar to students who have used that system.

  > "Before Gravitas, I was afraid to ask someone to share their experience with me when I was stuck. Now I can make that request confidently, because when someone responds, I know they really want to." - Alan Turing

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > By now we have hopefully made clear the benefits of Gravitas to a cohort. Download the repo from https://github.com/Zebrots/Zebrots. See our FAQ for more info.
